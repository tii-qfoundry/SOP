# Masked optical litography (395 nm)
> [!NOTE]
> Procedure is specified for both positive (exosed area is removed) and negative after image reversal (shadowed area is removed). You need to follow only the steps needed for image inversion when needed.

### Physical Hazards:
Appripiate UV eye protection needs to be worn if using exposed UV light sources.
### Equipment and Engineering Controls:
The work should be performed inside the Cleanroom because a controlled. Claenroom standard PPE is sufficent. In case of inadequate ventilation wear respiratory protection. 
If technical exhaust or ventilation measures are not possible or insufficient, respiratory protection must be worn. Respiratory protection necessary at: aerosol or
mist generation. Filtering device (full mask or mouthpiece) with filter: A. Do not allow uncontrolled leakage of products into the environment.
|Personal Protective Equipment |
|---|
| Clenaroom gown. Latex or nitrile gloves.|

### Response Procedures
**Spillage**: Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, contain spill, ventilate area of spill or leak. Collect onto inert absorbent. Place in suitable container.

**First aid measures**: Provide fresh air. In case of breathing difficulties administer oxygen. If victim is at
risk of losing consciousness, position and transport on their side. Call a physician immediately. After
inhalation, Provide fresh air. In case of breathing difficulties administer oxygen. If victim is at risk of
losing consciousness, position and transport on their side. Call a physician immediately. After contact
with skin, wash immediately with plenty of water and soap. If product gets into the eye, keep eyelid
open and rinse immediately with large quantities of water, for at least 15 minutes. Call physician.

## Handling, Storage and Waste Disposal of Hazardous Materials
Store all chemicals in labelled containers. Keep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and wellventilated place. Protect from frost, heat and sunlight.
Do not dispose of chemical wastes by dumping them down a sink, flushing in a toilet or discarding in regular trash containers, unless authorized by the cleanroom staff. 


## Detailed Fabrication Procedure

Follow the baseline substrate preparation and cleaning procedure. The substrate needs to be clean and dry, with no more than 30 minutes of exposure to air after the native oxide strip  when native oxides are to be avoided. The procedure consists of three steps: Spin coating of photoresistive resist, UV masked exposure and development.

### Step 1: Spin coating

### Step 2: UV masked exposure

### Step 3: resist Development
