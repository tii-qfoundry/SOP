# General Dicing of Substrates
> [!NOTE]
> When the dicing saw starts the cooling water system, a drop of pressure may force the system to nhalt the dicing saw motor. TRo avoid thiss, always manually sytart the warter system before starting the cutting job.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not open either of the lids while the dicing saw motor is running.

### Physical Hazards:
Fast moving blades. 

### Administrative Controls:
All the process needs to be carried insikde the facilities of the quantum foundry, during working hours (8 am to 6pm).
User needs to be trained and authorized ti use the equipment before excecuting this procedure.

### Equipment and Engineering Controls:
> Cleanroom standard PPE is sufficent.
> Always confirm that the work covers are well closed before starting a cut.
- Do not open the covers while the machine is in operation. Do not operate the machine with the covers removed.
- If there is an accident while operating the machine, press the EMO switch and stop the machine.
- Before working inside the machine, caution the personnel working around the machine not to operate with the touch-panel screen.
- Before operating the cutting unit, confirm there is no interfering object within the working range. Before starting operation, make sure that there are no foreign objects, such as tools, inside the machine.
- Never release the cover interlock while the machine is in operation.

|Personal Protective Equipment |

### Response Procedures
**First Aid**: 
Physical Cut: When possible use the cleanroom first aid kit to contain any body fluids and seek first aid assistance. For deep cuts or 
Chemical Skin contact: Solution may cause skin burns. Remove contaminated clothing. Flush the affected area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention. 
Eye contact: Solution is irritating to eyes. Flush contaminated eye(s) immediately with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately. 

**Spill Response**:
Minor spills can be diluted and neutralized with acid neutralizer spill kit. Large spills should be contained. 

**Fire Response**:
Do not use water. If water is added to concentrate acid a severe eruption may result. Use a carbon dioxide or dry chemical extinguisher.

## Handling, Storage and Waste Disposal of Hazardous Materials
### Waste management
- Throw away the used tape in the general waste bin. 
- Throw away the pipette and the wipes contaminated with the S1805 resist in the Hazardous contaminated bin. 
- Throw away the wipes contaminated with IPA, acetone and NMP in the solvent contaminated bin. 
- Pour NMP, IPA and Acetone in the cup sinks of the solvent wet bench. 

## Detailed Fabrication Procedure
### Overview
A didcing saw (the machine) is designed to cut a workpiece (the substrate) precisely with ultra-thin outer-peripheral-cutter diamond blades which are rotated at high speed by super-precise air-spindles having high-speed motors. The machine sets the workpiece manually. The cutting position is determined 
automatically by an alignment function that uses image processing, or manually using multiple alignemnt position refrence points. Cutting and cleaning is performed automatically based on the data stored in the machine (recipe). The workpiece is unloaded manually.
During a normal cutting operqation, constant flow of DI water is required for blade cooling and to remove burr. The cutting motor is a high speed air spindle, reaching speeds as high as 60000 rpm, anmd cut speeds (translation) of a few mm/s. The spindle is fixed at a single position and can perfoirm cuts only in straight lines accross the sample.


### System Checks
- Check thart the system water flow interlock light located on the top panel is ON (all LEDs in the chill water flow controller on the backside oif the mainframe should be ON).
- Check that all power supplies, vaccum sensors and pump controllers and the thickness monitor are ON.
- Check that the manual vent valve in the deposition chamber is CLOSED. Check that the nitrogen intake valve to the system's pumps is OPEN.
- In normal coinditions, both the load-lock and the deposition chamber should be in vaccum.

### Cutting Procedure
#### Step 1: Prepare the substrate for cutting
1. Install the wafer in the spin coater. 
2. Coat the wafer with a layer of S1805 resist using a 5 mL pipette. 
3. Start the recipe with the spin coater interface. 
4. Once the recipe is finished, bake the wafer at 100 C for 1 minute on the hot plate.
5. Place the substrate on the center of the laminator with the resist facing the vacuum chuck and the flat of the substrate on the right.
6. Install a mounting frame, using the flat side to the right.
7. Pull the tape to the bottom of the vacuum check and apply the tape to the wafer, covering both the substrate and the metal frame.
8. Check that no bubbles remain on the substrate, and if so using a ruler carefully push them out.

#### Step 2: Cut the substrate and clean
9. Turn on the Accretech SS10, the exhaust and open the compressed air. 
10. Load the substrate holder frame withb the flat towards you, in the machine. 
11. Select the recipe.
12. Align the sample and start dicing on both channels. 
13. Unload the wafer holder and detach the 22 mm x 22 m pieces from the tape. 
14. Dip each sample in NMP bath at 70 C for 5 minutes. 
15. Dip each sample in acetone bath at room temperature for 5 minutes using the sonicator. 
16. Dip each sample in IPA bath at room temperature for 5 minutes using the sonicator. 
17. Dry each sample using nitrogen gun. 
18. Pour IPA/NMP and Acetone in the solvent cup sink 
19. Rince the beakers 

## Troubleshooting
The VAT Vacuum Control Gate valve between the deposition chamber and the turbo pump should be fully open whenever the pump is turned on or when is shutdown to ensure proper equalization of the pressure between the two sides of the turbo. Do not try to open this gate valve when there is a pressure differential in the pump. To equalize in vaccum, let the turbo pump stop by itself and then manually vent the chamber using the auxiliary vent valve. Open the VAT gate valve once atmospheric pressure is reached.
