# Cleanmroom Shutdown Routine.
> [!NOTE]
> The Cleanroom should in general not be shutdown unless systems will be out of operation for over a month or maitenance schedules requires so. Equipment will always change their operational conditions after a shutdown an fabrication recipes need to be tuned accordingly. Some equipment components will have their lifetime reduced when subject to shutdowns.

> [!WARNING]
> When the substrate holder is heated, it needs to cool down in the vented load-lock chamber until it reaches a temperature below 50C (approximately 30 min) before any additional process is carried.

### Physical Hazards:
Heated substrates and parts can be extremely hot and cause severe burns, handle them with care. Intense light will be emitted from the plasma, avoid looking at it directly. 

### Equipment and Engineering Controls:
> Cleanroom standard PPE is sufficent.

## Detailed Fabrication Procedure
### Overview
Each system in the cleanroom needs to follow proper shutdown to ensure that the lifetime of its components is maximized and that their operational conditions are minimally chnaged. 
In general it comprises of shutting off process gas flows, electron beam sources, vaccum pumps, purge gases and compressed air, electrical power supplies for each equipment in that order, and the general exhaust systems, air handling units and main power supplies. 
Emergency systems and controls and access controls should remain active or replaced for temporary controls while shutdown.
This SOP describes the shutdown procedures for each individual system.

### RAITH EBeam Litography System
#### Shutdown of Column and Computers.
- Set *Column Stop* mode in the RAITH software suite, and wait for the column to shut down.
- Close all windows and exit the software.
- Turn off the computer from windows.
#### System Shutdown
- Press the *Standby* button in the ebeam body and wait for 2 minutes.
- Press the *off* button.
- Close the compressed air and nitrogen lines.
- Go to the main power switch (outside of the cleanroom, on top of the power distribution cabinet) and set the switch to the *OFF* position. All units in the rack should now be disconnected from the supply.

### AJA Sputtering System



## Troubleshooting
The VAT Vacuum Control Gate valve between the deposition chamber and the turbo pump should be fully open whenever the pump is turned on or when is shutdown to ensure proper equalization of the pressure between the two sides of the turbo. Do not try to open this gate valve when there is a pressure differential in the pump. To equalize in vaccum, let the turbo pump stop by itself and then manually vent the chamber using the auxiliary vent valve. Open the VAT gate valve once atmospheric pressure is reached.
