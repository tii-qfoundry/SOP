# Microfabrication of optical Micro-mirrors

> [!WARNING]
> Triclorosilane (F13TCS) is a hazardous chemical. It reacts violently with water (H2O) producing SiO2, chlorine (Cl) gas, hydrogen chloride (HCl) and heat. Spills of trichlorosilane may be neutralized by using NaOH or NaHCO3, per one or two part of trichlorosilane.

##   Description
Fabrication of micro-mirrors with radius of curvature of 800um, for which Ormocomp (UV curable polymer) and 
F13TCS (anti-sticking monolayer agent) are used. A mold made of silicon or glass is used, in which we will 
dispense the Ormocomp and cure it with UV light. Prior to dispensing OrmoComp, we will need to pre-treat the 
mold by coating it with a monolayer of F13TCS, to allow the easy removal of the cured polymer from the mold. 

|Materials| Description | Manufacturer | HMDS|

|Ormocomp | UV-curable Hybrid Polymer for optical applications)| MicroResist | |
|F13TCS| Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane | | |

##   Hazards
### Chemical Hazards:
|Chemicals|**Hazard Statements**|Safety Sign|
|---|---|---|
| F13 Trichlorosilane, Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane, CAS 78560-45-9. | Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. Reacts violently with water. | <img src="https://github.com/tii-qfoundry/SOP/assets/14344419/59c6472e-11ec-4888-907a-a8a18f57b702" width=100> 
| OrmoComp (MicroResist) | Causes skin irritation, May cause an allergic skin reaction, Causes serious eye irritation, Suspected of damaging fertility | |

### Physical Hazards:
Appripiate UV eye protection needs to be worn if using exposed UV light sources.
### Equipment and Engineering Controls:
The work should be performed in the Cleanroom because a controlled, clean environment is needed. PPE is required. In case of inadequate ventilation wear respiratory protection. 
If technical exhaust or ventilation measures are not possible or insufficient, respiratory protection must be worn. Respiratory protection necessary at: aerosol or
mist generation. Filtering device (full mask or mouthpiece) with filter: A. Do not allow uncontrolled leakage of products into the environment.
|Personal Protective Equipment |
|---|
| Eye protection (goggles), Full Face shield, Hands protection (rubber gloves), Laboratory gown.|

### Response Procedures
**Spillage**: Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible absorbent material, (e.g. sand,
earth, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to local /
national regulations. Do not flush with water. Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal.
First aid measures: Provide fresh air. In case of breathing difficulties administer oxygen. If victim is at
risk of losing consciousness, position and transport on their side. Call a physician immediately. After
inhalation, Provide fresh air. In case of breathing difficulties administer oxygen. If victim is at risk of
losing consciousness, position and transport on their side. Call a physician immediately. After contact
with skin, wash immediately with plenty of water and soap. If product gets into the eye, keep eyelid
open and rinse immediately with large quantities of water, for at least 15 minutes. Call physician.

## Handling, Storage and Waste Disposal of Hazardous Materials
Store all chemicals in labelled containers. Do not fill Trichlorosilane containers, and open slowly to release built up gases. Do not dissolve Trichlorosilane in wate or neutralize.
Do not dispose of chemical wastes by dumping them down a sink, flushing in a toilet or discarding in regular trash containers, unless authorized by the cleanroom staff. 
Trichlorosilane needs to be disposed in a separate container, without neutralization, and appropiatly labelled.
Dispose Ormocomp following standard disposal rocedures for photo-resists.

## Detailed Fabrication Procedure
- In a vaccum oven, place the mold and a Pyrex Petri dish with 1 ml of F13TCS. Heat it up to
120C. This step will lead to the formation of a monolayer of F13TCS on the surface of the mold,
acting as a anti-sticking layer. Wait for 10 min and remove from the oven.
- In a fumehood, dispense the OrmoComp, in liquid form, into the pre-treated mold.
- Cure the OrmoComp using UV light.
- Separate the cured Ormocomp from the mold.
